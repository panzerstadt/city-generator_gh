roadmap for design augmentaion tool v0.1:

Now - rain occlusion
End of Feb/first week of March - live and historical weather data
End of Feb/first week of March .5 - expose all baking buttons
Mid March - The ability to stitch existing site model to expanded city model + retrieve google earth imagery automatically
End March - live and historical traffic data
Mid April - NDVI - automatically create trees
Mid April .5 - link wind/rain data to tree growth on site with rain occlusion
Near Future - integrate Apartment Design Guide (NSW_au) to create feasibility study tool

Nagging at the back of my head - solving projection issues once and for all
Possible solution for nag - retrieve google earth imagery automatically instead of manually


Laundry list:

- integrate vane (http://owm.io/) for ndvi and more /or manually code ndvi calculator
- the ability to stitch existing site model in whatever fashion into expanded city model
- twitter and facebook by coordinates
- restaurant recommendations
- the ability to parse regulation pdfs and extract important regulations that relate to different phases of design - by country
- ML - machine learning for the data sources
- ML - image recognition and dense captioning on google street view photos to read subjective density data
- vray render automation + batch rendering
- ML - integrating Vision API for some shallow captioning of image sources that could be retrived regarding site (fb, twitter?)
